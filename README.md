# Python-Challenge

Greetings,

Welcome to the Python-Basic-Analysis repository! Within this project, a basic analysis is conducted on two separate .csv files utilizing Python. The first analysis contained within the 'PyBank' directory, summarizes the raw data consisting of generated monthly profit/loss numbers over roughly eight years. The executed script aggregates the data and returns a financial analysis report including the total number of months represented in the dataset, the net total of profits/losses over the entire period, the global average change amount, the single greatest increase in profits (with its corresponding date) and the single greatest decrease in profits (with its corresponding date). This report is subsequently exported as an included .txt file as well.

The second analysis found within the 'PyPoll' directory, aggregates a generated dataset consisting of a town's election votes comprised of 'Voter ID', 'County' and 'Candidate' columns. The executed script both returns and exports a .txt file containing the total number of votes cast in the election, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won and lastly the winner of the election bases on the popular vote.

**Repository Structure:**

- 'PyBank' directory:
  - 'Analysis' directory:
    - "Py_Bank_Analysis.txt"
  - 'Resources' directory:
    - "budget_data.csv"
  - "PyBank_main.py"
 
- 'PyPoll' directory:
  - 'Analysis' directory:
    - "Py_Poll_Analysis.txt"
  - 'Resources' directory:
    - "election_data.csv"
  - "PyPoll_main.py"

Cheers!

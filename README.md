# Python-Challenge

Greetings!

Please see the included x2 Python files that contain code for the respective analysis of the two included csv file datasets (one for a profit/loss exercise and the other for an election result exercise). Please also note each project folder includes an "Analysis" folder that contains the text file produced from command line execution of the python file.

Cheers!
